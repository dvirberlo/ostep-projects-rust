# ostep-projects-rust

my solutions for ostep projects in rust

---

Thanks [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) for introducing me to this lecture.
I really enjoyed the professor's lectures, but I was a bit slow on the projects, since I had almost no experience in low level programming.

I abandoned the projects for a while , but then I restated them with rust.
Hopefully the most loved programming language (according to [Stack Overflow](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)) will induce me to finish all the projects.
